/**
 * Example: Minimal
 * Description:
 *   This example will shows the bare minimum required for IotWeConf to start up.
 *   After starting up the thing, please search for WiFi access points e.g. with
 *   your phone. Use password provided in the code!
 *   After connecting to the access point the root page will automatically appears.
 *   We call this "captive portal".
 *   
 *   Please set a new password for the Thing (for the access point) as well as
 *   the SSID and password of your local WiFi. You cannot move on without these steps.
 *   
 *   You have to leave the access point before to let the Thing continue operation
 *   with connecting to configured WiFi.
 *
 *   Note that you can find detailed debug information in the serial console depending
 *   on the settings IOTWEBCONF_DEBUG_TO_SERIAL, IOTWEBCONF_DEBUG_PWD_TO_SERIAL set
 *   in the IotWebConf.h .
